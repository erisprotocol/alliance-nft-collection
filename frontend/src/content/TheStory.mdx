  # The Story

  <div className={styles.section}>
    ## The Last Journey
    Millions of years ago, the human race was in peril. Earth was facing destruction, threatening the Existence of all known life in the universe.

    War had ravaged the earth for centuries. The resource wars between the world’s nations had left the earth utterly decimated, and humanity could no longer survive. Leaders from all ten of the world’s remaining nations had only one choice: band together, or face the annihilation of all life.

    The Alliance Coalition was formed, where 100 of the world’s top scientists and engineers came together to work on a single goal: create a device to save humanity. After years of planning, scouting, false hope, and failure, the population of the earth had reached dismal levels. Just as the candle of life was preparing to be extinguished, the remaining handful of engineers in the Coalition were successful in creating the Alliance module: a device for altering space-time, creating pathways between planets billions of light years apart.

    Only ten of these devices could be created, each given to one-tenth of the Earth’s remaining population. Astronomers and extraterrestrial geologists were able to  pinpoint 10 planets scattered through the universe with the ability to nurture life. Provisions were made, and with the last dwindling resources of Earth, humans started The Last Journey. To preserve life, the world’s remaining 10,000 people would be split and transported to each of the 10 planets to create a new home. The hope was that at least one of these colonies would survive, and humanity could continue. However, this exodus could only be made once. The Alliance module required elements with no known naturally-occuring isotopes to function, and the synthesis of these elements took years to complete in the world’s last operating particle accelerator. With only one chance to work, the devices were used, and all 10 factions were transported successfully.

    ## Arrival
    The settlers arrived to these new planets hungry and tired, and with barely enough energy to begin the terraforming process. Though the planets were barren, it was determined that some of the last extant plants and animals would be adapted to survive on each of the new world's varying alien and treacherous terrains.
    After first arriving, inhabitants of the 10 worlds devised methods to preserve their culture and intellectual advancement. Copies of all known human history, culture, and intellectual advancement were given to each of the 10 worlds. But after a few generations, the devices used to store and access this knowledge began to deteriorate. The technological setback after the first 15 generations was severe, as the tools for manufacturing and knowledge-transfer brought from earth corroded and turned to dust, and primitive replacements could not be made fast enough or with enough precision to preserve what was lost. Cultures devolved into primitive collectives with only one goal: survival.

    ## The Event
    For millions of years, the inhabitants of these planets have lived in isolation, not knowing about each other, or that other life in the universe exists. Recently, a strange event occurred (simply called “The Event”).  Without warning, inhabitants from each of the 10 planets were transported instantaneously to random destinations throughout each of the 10 planets. For example, someone from the water planet now finds themselves on the fire planet, and someone from the forest planet is now on the desert planet. Some individuals were even transported to a random location on their home planet. In total, 10,000 individuals (1000 per planet) shifted their locations across the 10 planets. Each NFT is a vignette of them in their new location recently after The Event occurred. The individuals carry items, either that they found on their new planet, or that they were holding when they were transported.

    ## The Alliance device
    All 10 alliance devices contain quantum entangled particles that are monitored, allowing for synchronous communication between devices across billions of lightyears.

    The devices essentially create wormholes, bending spacetime and creating tunnels between  distant locations, allowing for near-instantaneous travel.

    The devices are able to transport individuals based on their genetic biosignature. All 10 cultures have unique biosignatures, and each device is calibrated according to these signatures.

    The devices were only intended to be used once, but they each contain a hidden protocol to transport everyone back to earth if activated.
