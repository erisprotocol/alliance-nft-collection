    ## The Last Journey
    Millions of years ago, the human race was in peril. Earth was facing destruction, threatening the Existence of all known life in the universe.

    War had ravaged the earth for centuries. The resource wars between the world's nations had left the earth utterly decimated, and humanity could no longer survive. Leaders from all ten of the world's remaining nations had only one choice: band together, or face the annihilation of all life.

    The Alliance Coalition was formed, where 100 of the world's top scientists and engineers came together to work on a single goal: create a device to save humanity. After years of planning, scouting, false hope, and failure, the population of the earth had reached dismal levels. Just as the candle of life was preparing to be extinguished, the remaining handful of engineers in the Coalition were successful in creating the Alliance module: a device for altering space-time, creating pathways between planets billions of light years apart.

    Only ten of these devices could be created, each given to one-tenth of the Earth's remaining population. Astronomers and extraterrestrial geologists were able to pinpoint 10 planets scattered through the universe with the ability to nurture life. Provisions were made, and with the last dwindling resources of Earth, humans started The Last Journey. To preserve life, the world's remaining 10,000 people would be split and transported to each of the 10 planets to create a new home. The hope was that at least one of these colonies would survive, and humanity could continue. However, this exodus could only be made once. The Alliance module required elements with no known naturally-occuring isotopes to function, and the synthesis of these elements took years to complete in the world's last operating particle accelerator. With only one chance to work, the devices were used, and all 10 factions were transported successfully.

    ## Arrival
    The settlers arrived to these new planets hungry and tired, and with barely enough energy to begin the terraforming process. Though the planets were barren, it was determined that some of the last extant plants and animals would be adapted to survive on each of the new world's varying alien and treacherous terrains.
